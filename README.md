# sorting-algorithms-visualizer
this a sorting algorithms visualizer with quick sort and bubble sort. 


Quick sort
is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961, 
it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well,
it can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times faster than heapsort.
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. 
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. 
The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. 
Efficient implementations of Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.



BUBBLE SORT, 
sometimes referred to as sinking sort,
is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, 
which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
